NO2/CO Sensor:
Does not function

For future team:
Add sensor footprint so sensor can be plugged directly into board.


Ethylene Sensor:
Partial Functionality, board has no shorts but continuously outputs 3V with and without the sensor plugged in.
Rev 2 had the wrong opamp power supply polarity, Rev 3 fixed this issue.
A rev 2 board was soldered and jumper wire patched the power supply polarity issue.

For future team:
Add sensor footprint so sensor can be plugged directly into board.
Double check the schematic again with the reference design.

Methane Sensor:
Partial Functionality, the lamp works but the output signal is noisy and does not respond.

For future team:
Check opamp circuit and compare schematic to reference design.
